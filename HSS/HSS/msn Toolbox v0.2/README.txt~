Description:
MATLAB routines dealing with HSS matrices and doing 1D / 2D
interpolations. All the routines operating on HSS matrices start 
with a hss_, all the routines doing MSN interpolation start with 
msn_. Call help <routines name> for examples and more informations 
on the routines.

The detailed documentation can be found in:

http://scg.ece.ucsb.edu 

Any suggestions or comments are welcome.

Version: 0.2
Last revision: 13-Oct-10 
Added CODA version of the MSN Interpolation algorithm in 1D and 2D.
Also added CODA algorithm itself for stability for large s, especially in 2D.
